<h2>R&eacute;sum&eacute;</h2><span class="markdown">

This computer ontology is intended to describe in an explicit and formal way the features of an exhibition or a collection display (identification of the exhibition, proximity and contiguity of the works, vis-à-vis, etc.).
It adopts a topological perspective on the exhibition in order to describe the relationship between space and exhibit, and between exhibit and exhibit. This ontology is developed at the [Ouvroir laboratory](https://ouvroir.umontreal.ca) within the partnership [New Uses of Collections in Art Museums](https://cieco.co/en/projects/partnership) (2021-2028).
The project supported by the University of Montreal, the Canada Fund for Innovation, and the Province of Quebec.
Project manager: Zoë Renaudie.
Scientific director: Emmanuel Château-Dutier.
